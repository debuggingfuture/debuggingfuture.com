    <title>Learning magics in Berlin with my younger self</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<!-- ## Learning magics in Berlin with my younger self --><p>After 15 years I’m finally in Germany again, with a purpose. </p><p><img src="/berlin24/berlin24.jpg" alt="img"></p><p>I was an exchange student in Bonn. Besides drank enough beer to fill a swimming pool and took 30+ budget flights travelling around, I also studied some Microeconomics and Distributed Systems. “Too early” as Vitalik was still playing World of Warcraft and little did I imagine how game theories and consensus algorithms that I learned together with various technologies were going to transform our world.</p><p>Time flies, with detours in my career, I’m back to where I started and look for impactful, open technologies that I could commit my time to, and ponder what my role is in the rapidly changing world with all sort of new possibilities. </p><p>I came to the historic, rebellious city to pick up my memories and participate the “co-living” experience ZuBerlin, which is a 2 weeks mini-<a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/10/06/why-i-built-zuzalu/">Zuzalu</a> for online communities connected by values such as Ethereum’s coming together to materialize a mini-village in the spacetime.</p><hr><p>For some reasons, Core Devs of Ethereum are named as <a href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/">Magicians</a>, and indeed it felt like magics to me when I was attending workshops led by them, which are full of first principles thinking, holistic design and diverse opinions. Partly a research retreat, teams are working hard to work around complex challenges related to MEV or censorship-resistance to achieve low latency user experience with <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/based-preconfirmations/17353">based sequencing &amp; pre-confirmations</a>. Truth to be told, I’m not a researcher and find it challenging to catch up all latest development from the gigabrains. Besides, every meal during the week I was sitting with founders, PhDs, overwhelmed by all the grand and wild ideas, abstract in technical or philosophical sense.</p><p>But that’s exactly why I’m here. </p><p>Excited that I got a chance to witness how Ethereum is being built. Decentralized, open discourses are conducted that welcome ideas and critiques. People with all sorts of background commit to build on Ethereum and some become leading contributors. Faces in recurring distributed calls met in real life to present ideas, jam on designs and implementations with solutions that <a href="https://x.com/drakefjustin/status/1801321889152835758">work suprisingly well</a>. Decentralization works, when, literally, so much is at stake. </p><p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GP-OxuoW8AAAUOM?format=jpg&name=large" alt="img"></p><p>Tired of conferences in this industry full of shilling and pumping which ironically never induce deep conversations, here offers plenty, with a diverse and solarpunk community rightfully condensed in this multicultural city, Berlin, where freedom is continually fought for. Young, bright, motivated folks try to build the next frontiers and experienced, accomplished or unfulfilled ones look for ways to reinvent themselves. People have different agenda, but what is common is you can tell they’re motivated by some strong beliefs and not money. </p><p>My magic moment of ZuBerlin, is however not during the talks.</p><p>It’s a peacful sunny afternoon. Vitalik, having just wrapped up a presentation on his brillant proposal with a satisfying geeky smile, was playing innocently with a kid (and made him cry), alongside the laughters from the communities who then move on to chat about their own great ideas and brillant plans.</p><p><img src="/berlin24/vitalik.jpg" alt="img"></p><p>Symbolic as it is, as an average individual who spent many of my waking hours overthinking on problems and anguishing over my trading position or social status, it is good to stop for a moment, discard my non-European expectation of “efficiency” and join the geeky but wise and thoughtful ones to embrace a bit of techno-optimism, to celebrate the beauty of mathematics, applied by clever engineering in AI &amp; crypto, and to appreciate the communities empowered by technologies to shape a better world as <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/27/techno_optimism.html#dacc">“humanity is deeply good”</a>. </p><p>That optimism, is what truly motivate us building here. Once again I’m convinced blockchain isnt only about technology, <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/05/29/l2culture.html#:~:text=The%20core%20value%20proposition%20of,infrastructure%20to%20achieve%20those%20values.">but also the culture</a>, not just <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html">smart contracts but also the social contracts.</a></p><p>Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing sacred and the Ethereum ecosystem is a mess. But it’s a working mess, a permissionless, forkable technology that likeminds are building upon.  </p><p>Frankly speaking, the logistics was far from perfect and algining expectations of a diverse audience fairly and transparently is fundamentally challenging, but that’s the point as we came here to join an <a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/10/06/why-i-built-zuzalu/">experiment</a> and tribute to the tremendous effort with all the good intentions in putting it together.</p><p>Identifying myself as a builder, thie trip won’t be completed without getting my hands dirty on new ideas. With the motiv of creating “Community Notes” to make the experience more inclusive, I ended up with a scrappy demo but pretty proud to have written code for the UI &amp; smart contract on my flight back to Singapore without Internet, making to the submission deadline when I land in Changi. Can’t be more happy getting the “Silver Squirrel” prize covering my trip.   </p><hr><p>Probably I’ve watched too many eposides of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_(TV_series)">“The Dark”</a>, I wonder which year I’m in, walking along the platforms of Deutsche Bahn stations. From color palette of train schedules to the smell after a football match, as an revisiting outsider, Germany didnt seems to have changed much. Did I? </p><div class="row">  <div class="col col-md-6"><p><img src="/berlin24/berlin_old.jpg" alt="img">  </p></div>  <div class="col col-md-6"><p><img src="/berlin24/berlin_new.jpg" alt="img">  </p></div></div><p>Allow me to have indulged in nostalgia, picking up memories from bookstores to supermarket, from the Reichtag to the Brandenburg Gate. I got a chance to have a dialogue with my younger self, pondered what I wished and feared. Different ambitions, still the curious and somehow idealistic person, perhaps. “Vorbei ist Vorbei”, I can’t change the past, but I’m gateful this trip helped me to reflect and reimagine what are paths I could be taking as I open a new chapter of my career and life.</p><p>There is a lot to learn ahead, and hope is what it takes for my redepmption.<br>I’m genuinely happy to be still alive, when my good old classmate and travel companion could ony live in my memories.</p>]]></content>

During that period it is quite essential that the administrative, social and other systems should be at peak performance. That is now at risk because the key people able to ensure it are leaving.

組屋前還過來考察。父親從廉租屋邨搬到居屋再買私樓，正是那一代的向上流故事。80 年代包玉剛「棄舟上岸」，李嘉誠入主和黃。和黃的倉庫被改建成了第一代屏風樓，也就有了我今天住的和富（wharf）道。</p><p>數十年過去，量化寬鬆、強國走資、熱錢湧入，<br>香港人依舊喜歡買磚頭；比起「保值」，居住是種次要的需求。全球大城市這比比皆是，而新加坡的組屋呎價還是平上一截，可以用強積金當首期；而台北人只覺得你房子太小根本不能生活。也好，反正香港工時冠絕全球。電影版《攻款機動隊》回到香港取景，畫面不是超現實，而是超級現實。漸漸，政府叫你去大灣區，Facebook feed 上出現日越泰馬的樓盤廣告。</p><p><img src="/stand/buildings.jpeg" alt="img"></p><p>在西營盤長大，這區既保留了開埠早期的老香港，又是近年所謂士紳化最具代表的寫照。</p><p>地鐵通車翻天覆地，摘去森記、可可、新中華，罅隙中種出一棟棟大廈，配上個豪宅的名字和價錢。老店甚至老街坊，在這沒有記憶的城市，都不被允許存在。社區的連結花費數代人的時光去建立，原來又可以一夜間斷裂。</p><p>從前會去踢足球的卜公花園，是個諷刺的存在：19 世紀初鼠疫爆發，首要措施是清拆人口密度過高的太平山街，改建公園讓住所保留空間。而今天數街之隔的<a href="https://hk.news.appledaily.com/local/realtime/article/20180112/57699753">德星里</a>和<a

年代爸媽忙著考會考，而不是批鬥他們的父母。<br>所以小時候每周都會和「爺爺嫲嫲」、「公公婆婆」團圓聚餐。<br>父母都工作，<br>由曾在停泊香港的美軍艦隊上工作、避過日本兵追捕的外婆湊大了我。<br>小學到中學就讀教會學校，<br>有點諷刺，卻使我成了堅定的無神論者。</p><p><img src="/stand/sls.jpg" alt="img"></p><p>校園本身就是歷史文物，創校可追溯到 19 世紀。「鬼佬」神父們為何選擇札根香港，是從前不懂問的問題。<br>原來開埠時香港是個很 Ghetto 的第三世界，湧入大量逃避太平天國飢荒的難民和棄嬰。1848 年聖保祿修女便<a href="http://www.srspc.org.hk/tc/origin_hk.php">開始設立孤兒院</a>、和屹立至今的<a href="http://kkp.org.hk/node/16862">學校和醫院</a>。不少名校如協恩、嘉諾撒、拔萃的前身，都是這種孤兒院。及後東華三院、保良局才相繼成立、針對當時的瘟疫和人口拐賣問題 。</p><p><img src="/stand/sp.jpeg" alt="img"></p><blockquote><p>聖保祿女修會</p></blockquote><p>那時學校彌撒的「貴賓」，後來才明白往往是校長的上司。<br>人道理由和政治原因，神父們在不同國家傳教輾轉到了香港。香港和澳門作為橋頭堡，背後是整個天主教系統在東亞的佈局。<br>我也還趕得上，實際上用中文教的「英文中學」，而不是中中，更不是普教中。政府資助的辦學模式，令我身邊有不少草根階層的同學 ── 這對我的想法影響很大，對建制貴族帶點本能的抗拒。今天從 Playgroup 到直資再到大灣區的教育，是另一回事。</p><p>我成長的，是報攤還在賣叮噹和龍珠單行本的 90 年代。<br>透明機殼的 Gameboy 在銅鑼灣大丸購買，日打夜打的是那 Pokemon 紅版。數年後第一次剪貼著 Javascript，是為了做個 Pokemon 網站再放上 Yahoo!的目錄。然後 20 年後用著類似的技倆維生。</p><p><img src="/stand/pokemon.png" alt="img"></p><p><a href="http://www.oocities.org/hkpoketrainer/trainer.htm">17 年前的網站，居然被 backup 了</a></p><p>當年還有個叫做亞視的電視台，兒時「轉台」只為了看有點兒童不宜的《蠟筆小新》，和後來在家長不在時看「家長指引」的暴走初號機。之後掀起了日劇戰，每天電視都是木村拓哉。</p><p>結果有一年的生日沒有買玩具，在 SOGO 旭屋書店買了本日文字典，背起不懂唸的あいうえお。日本文化對我的影響由飲食、家品、潮流、審美，直到如何理解「青春」和「熱血」。再大了點慢慢學日文，除了旅遊、打機、看日劇和讀村上春樹，<a href="http://www.cuhkacs.org/~benng/Bo-Blog/read.php?1365">知日是為了理解香港</a>。</p><p>那時剛經歷民主運動的南韓選了個軍人做總統，金大中要到 97 年才上台。我初中時沒有 Girls’generation 和 Twice，到我不再看電視時才有《大長今》。BoA 剛出道，「韓流」是個剛剛才出現的詞語。除了 05 年在銅鑼灣一邊吃韓燒一邊看韓農示威，和韓國的交集很少。不像今天，K-POP 利用互聯網在越南等地取得幾何級的點擊數字。</p><hr><p>無厘頭年代，家中電視播得最多是周星馳的鹿鼎記。</p><p><img src="/stand/stevenchow.jpg" alt="img"></p><p>金庸的頂峰之作，寫的是「世界仔」韋小寶。<br>查良鏞原在上海大公報任翻譯，48 年被調到香港。<br>到了北京外交官沒當成，又回到香港，結識了同事梁羽生、<br>創辦明報，才開始了「飛雪連天射白鹿」。</p><p>電影中演阿珂的叫 Michele Monique Reis，父親是香港出生的葡萄牙人。日治時期被關進深水埗集中營當戰俘，再送往日本掘礦。投降後回港才生了李嘉欣。<br>周星馳眾所周知做過 430 穿梭機、出身<a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hk/%E7%84%A1%E7%B6%AB%E9%9B%BB%E8%A6%96%E8%97%9D%E5%93%A1%E8%A8%93%E7%B7%B4%E7%8F%AD">藝員訓練班</a>。同期的是梁朝偉，上一期的師兄是劉德華、梁家輝、黃耀明、徐錦江等。那時訓練班上的名字，耳熟能詳，近十年的我卻認不出幾個。</p><p>80 年代至 90 年代初是粵語片的黃金時期。極其本土的作品，講的是廣東話，卻也流行到日本台灣，而不是單一市場。而交流是雙向的，結果小時看電視播的《機動武鬥傳 G 高達》，決戰於「新香港」，反派叫東方不敗，絕招是<a href="http://www.cuhkacs.org/~benng/Bo-Blog/read.php?480">來自《俠客行》主角石破天的石破天驚拳</a>。</p><p>商業又帶點叛逆，大師們搵食之餘又建構了這彈丸之地的文化認同。今天導演王晶拍《賭城風雲》，周星馳拍《美人魚》，繼續大收，而身邊沒有人討論。只有荷蘭叻，在現實演活了「多隆」。</p><hr><p>03 年過去，才在電視聽多了張國榮梅艷芳。裝了寬頻，除了打機、隔兩年 Youtube 上線，慢慢追憶起那芳華絕代。<br>我追上的音樂潮流，大部分是向後的：Beyond、達明一派、羅大佑。</p><p>那時，慶幸是個陳奕迅和周董還未被稱為老土的年代。<br>會考温習時，帶在身邊的銀色鐵盒不是小米尿袋，而是 iPod。<br>歌單包括 The Best is yet to Come，又十數年後，來臨的是個<a href="https://m.mingpao.com/pns/dailynews/web_tc/article/20180812/s00005/1534010037451">不妥協傷口</a>。<br>最喜歡的香港女歌手是岑寧兒，演出大部分卻在台灣。</p><p>香港人太忙。太忙去聽音樂、<br>太忙去悲傷、太忙去問為甚麼。</p><hr><p>母親任教中國語文和歷史直至教改，我是個還在意書本的異類。</p><p>95 年落成的黃泥涌圖書館只有十數個書櫃，卻大抵塑造了內向的我的一生。七成的書還由台灣出版，童話故事裡標著堆我不懂的ㄅㄆㄇㄈ注音。到了青春期，<a href="https://www.thenewslens.com/article/100338">那時村上春樹還沒有被淫審署</a>封套，從挪威的森林一直看到 1Q84。閱讀是我的 comfort zone，做了十多年的圖書館管理員。</p><p>學懂了讀甚麼，又讀到了甚麼，又是種機緣巧合。</p><p>1949 年後，唐君毅和錢穆來港創立了新亞書院，及後饒宗頤、牟宗三、台大出生的金耀基輾轉到了合併了新亞的中大。於是，他們沒有像失明的陳寅恪被放個喇叭在床前批鬥至死、沒有像郭沬若寫了首寄調《水調歌頭》慶祝文革十周年的詞。</p><p>香港也沒有新加玻般抹剎華文的運動。如是者，我寫的是正體字，我也不討厭中文。我高考考 94 年開辦的「中國語文及文化科」和會考讀的中文，是這堆人的文章。既有國民政府教育部部長蔣夢麟的回憶錄《西潮》，又有國民黨政權打壓的殷海光。</p><p>偏偏，建構身份認同的這些，正是某種予盾的來源。</p><p>當然，這些這年代沒幾個人會在意。在意的是作文試題是<a href="https://www.hkcnews.com/article/12636/%E5%BB%89%E6%94%BF%E5%85%AC%E7%BD%B2-%E8%95%AD%E6%BA%90-%E7%8F%BE%E4%BB%A3%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2-12636/%E8%A3%9C%E7%BF%92%E5%90%8D%E5%B8%AB%E8%95%AD%E6%BA%90%E8%A2%AB%E6%8E%A73%E9%A0%85%E4%B8%8D%E8%AA%A0%E5%AF%A6%E5%8F%96%E7%94%A8%E9%9B%BB%E8%85%A6%E7%BD%AA-%E8%88%87%E5%A6%BB%E7%8D%B2%E5%87%86%E4%BF%9D%E9%87%8B">凍檬茶，還是火警演習眾生相</a>，在意的是如何從這群考生中賺取過億。</p><h2

和會計師等等。而反正世界如何，我和工程系的同學總在 Lab 打 Dota。<br>入學那年皇后碼頭剛被拆卸，而同輩都不太問政事、學生會開始被滲透。風暴是平靜的，畢竟當年的大學教授不會被登上環球時報。百周年校園開始興建，流過汗的 Soc 房和學生會的「獨立自主橋」被拆去，仿忽沒有存在過。</p><p><img src="/stand/hkusu.jpg" alt="img"></p><p>那些年，黃之鋒在我家樓下讀小學。<br>他們的青春，不在足球場，在公民廣場。迎接他們的不是 OCamp，是國教、雨傘運動和牢獄。</p><hr><p>50 年代韓戰、三反五反令人材資金湧入香港加速工業化時，李嘉誠在穿膠花。直至中國改革開放，百萬計的移民來到需要大量勞動力的香港，住廣州的外父外母剛好趕上 80 年結束的抵壘政策。</p><p>這背景其後催生了深圳經濟特區，那負責的廣東省委書記叫習仲勳。香港工業北移，亦不乏資金回流；香港憑特殊地位、法治和新聞自由，紥根多年的金融業再大幅發展。<br>今天香港人為甚麼最熱愛外遊，又有條件外遊，除了坐擁亞洲絕佳的地理位置、由千古罪人興建而效率第一的機場，又有本眾多免簽證的護照外，可和香港從出口業轉型、聯繫滙率的金融政策有關。</p><p>98 年的亞洲金融風暴，一岸之隔的台灣或基於出口壓力，或陰謀論，棄守新台幣滙率；最後香港則守住了轉戰而來的大鱷。當年新加玻和台灣的薪水還差不遠，不是種種下來，今天台灣夜市，才沒那麼「價廉物美」；現實的港商才不會對台灣那麼「求才若渴」。</p><p>而當年抵擋風暴的「拍擋 」── 一個是財政司司長曾任權，今天在赤柱服刑；另一個是格林斯潘盛讚的任志剛師兄，今天說的則是<a

href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hk/%E6%9B%BE%E6%98%AD%E7%A7%91">警隊有共諜</a>，冷戰時香港是東方的柏林。</p><hr><p>中環海事博物館有這樣的一個展品：地圖模型上，動畫訴說數百年前廣州就是中外交流重鎮、貨如輪轉、外國僑民者眾，中外銀號車水馬龍。直至後來被另一個城市取替，那就是香港。輕描淡寫，卻隱隱告誡著十年河東十年河西的歷史洪流。看完冒一身冷汗，只因今天只是角色倒轉。</p><p>脫去了那歷史和地緣政治，香港甚麼都不是。<br>由清潔運動培養起的公民意職，以至法治廉潔等整套政制可不容易搬；<br>又如廣東話配繁體字沒有香港這基地，便會失去生命。</p><p>「文化香港」嗎？不少人可能情感上懷緬香港，但香港沒條件做到<a

沒法去令這猛火不再燃<br> - 達明一派《十個救火的少年》</p></blockquote><hr><p>偽選舉偽權力偽政府，沒有說誰當選了就天下太平，儘管是一次又一次不能失守的失守。所謂Lesser Evil，重點不在這個人，在於人們投射的是甚麼價值。若當選後如何無能或反口覆舌，那己是後話。「民眾」當然有其三分鐘狂熱，對領袖批評也無可厚非，如邱吉爾下台時引用過的一句「對政治領袖無情，是偉大民族的標誌。」</p><p>所凝聚的希望和力量還是有可珍惜之處。龍和道沒有新的意義，但那夜的中環是多麼像台灣。泛民也算進步了在逆境打了場漂亮的杖，身邊不少朋友也甘願趟做選委這渾水出了一點力。</p><hr><h2

Brother沒有走遠。<br>而世界會變、<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006V3E1RI/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1">獨裁者會進化</a>，<a
