I believe in open source, decentralized technologies and companies and trying to build some.

It\'s our mission to make Technologies and Education empowering individuals so the world stays free, open, permissive, innovative and equal.

Worked in bank/startups, I'm getting more and more inspired by [indie.vc](http://indie.vc/), Remote work. [Indie Hacker](https://www.indiehackers.com/), Company of One & [Companies being more transparent](https://www.slideshare.net/Bufferapp/buffer-culture-04).

It\'s promised AI will give us more leisure and unleash our creativity. What if we are able to spend more time learning, creating and caring, when it also fulfills our necessities --- probably a more sustainable earth and civilization. For that I'm Learning 3d printing and hydroponics and looking forward to more projects like [FarmBot](https://farm.bot/). I wish people can start their company taking a fair share. Fan of OSS, [Self-hosted](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/) and try to apply [FinOps](https://www.finops.org/) in industry.


Mottos, iterating:
- Civilization is in a race between education and catastrophe.
- [Protocols, Not Platforms](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech)
- Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools. - Agile Manifesto
