I believe in open source, decentralized technologies and organizations, trying to build some.

Currently I focus on my Web3 Dev Studio [Fractal Box](https://fractal.box/), where we strive to create infrastructure & services to put [AI on chain](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2023/10/23/artificial-intelligence-belongs-onchain). We work on projects related to decentralized computing, AI agents coordination protocols and more. 

You can find case studies [here](https://fractal.box/#case-studies) where we also launched NFT communities of Animoca Brands and account abstraction enabled games of 500k+ MAU.

It\'s our mission to make Technologies and Education empowering individuals so the world stays free, open, permissive, innovative and equal.

Worked in bank/startups, I\'m inspired by [Indie Hacker](https://www.indiehackers.com/), Company of One & [Companies being more transparent](https://www.slideshare.net/Bufferapp/buffer-culture-04), business models powered by fair games.

Web3 is about ownership. DAO is about collaboration. Blockchain is not only about currency, but the biggest innovation that shapes our society works, I want to commit myself contributing better coordination & governance tools as in [Network State](https://thenetworkstate.com/) pioneered by Balaji, [Vitalik](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/07/13/networkstates.html) . I got lost during my journey in web2 and come late, but now I see it.

It\'s promised AI will give us more leisure and unleash our creativity. What if we are able to spend more time learning, creating and caring, when it also fulfills our necessities --- probably a more sustainable earth and civilization. For that I'm learning 3d printing, hydroponics and looking forward to more projects like [FarmBot](https://farm.bot/). I wish people can start their company taking a fair share.

I see [crypto technology give us a second chance](https://x.com/debuggingfuture/status/1786772431018840200) to build a regenerative economy with projects like Ethereum, [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/)

### Recent Experiements / Public Goods project
I like to keep up my learning by experimenting with different ideas at hackathons. I also organize developer communities & build on public goods / civic hacking projects since 2011.
