<!-- ## Learning magics in Berlin with my younger self -->

After 15 years I'm finally in Germany again, with a purpose.

I was an exchange student in Bonn. Besides drank enough beer to fill a swimming pool and took 30+ budget flights travelling around, I also studied some Microeconomics and Distributed Systems. I was "too early" as Vitalik was still playing World of Warcraft and little did I imagine how game theories and consensus algorithms that I learned together with various technologies were going to transform our world.

With detours in my career, I'm back to where I started and look for impactful, open technologies that I could commit my time to, and ponder what my role is the rapidly changing world with all sort of new possibilities. 

Thus I came to the historic, rebellious city to pick up my memories and participate the "co-living" experience ZuBerlin, which is a 2 weeks mini-[Zuzalu](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/10/06/why-i-built-zuzalu/) for online communities connected by values coming together to materialize a mini-village in our timespace.

For some reasons, Core Devs of Ethereum are named as [Magaicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/), and indeed it felt like magics to me when I attend workshops led by them, which are full of first principles thinking, holistic design and diverse opinions. Partly a research retreat, teams are working hard to work around complex challenges related to MEV or censorship-resistance to achieve low latency with [Based Sequencing & Pre-confirmations](https://ethresear.ch/t/based-preconfirmations/17353). I'm not a researcher and find it challenging to catch up all latest development form the gigabrains, and every meal during the week I was sitting with founders, PhDs, overwhelmed by all the grand and wild ideas, abstract in technical or philosophical sense.

But that's exactly why I'm here. 

Excited that I got a chance to witness how Ethereum is being built. Decentralized, open discourses that welcome ideas and critques, faces in distributed calls with all sorts of background commit to build on Ethereum and some become leading contributors, meet in real life and present ideas, jamming designs and implementation with solutions that work suprisingly well.
Decentralization works, when, literally, so much is at stake. 

Tired of conferences in this industry full of shilling and pumping which ironically never induce deep conversations, here offers plenty, with a diverse and solarpunk community rightfully condensed in the multicultural city, Berlin, where freedom is continually fought for. Young, bright, motivated folks try to build the next frontiers and experienced, accomplished or unfulfilled, look for ways to reinvent themselves. People has different agenda, but what's common, is you can tell they are motivated by some strong beliefs and not money. 

My magic moment of ZuBerlin, isn't during the talks.

It's the peacful sunny afternoon when I saw Vitalik playing innocently with a kid (and make him cry), alongside with laughters from the communities which then move on to share their ideas and plans.

Symbolic as it is, while I spent many of my waking hours overthink and anguish over my trading position or social status, it is good to stop for a moment, throw away my "Non European expectation of efficiency" and join the geeky but thoughtful ones to have a bit of techno-optimism, to celebrate the beauty of mathematics, applied by clever engineering in AI & crypto, and appreciate the communities empowered by technologies to shape a better world as ["humanity is deeply good"](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/27/techno_optimism.html#dacc). 

That optimism, is what truly motivate us building here. Once again I'm convinced blockchain isnt only about technology, [but also the culture](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/05/29/l2culture.html#:~:text=The%20core%20value%20proposition%20of,infrastructure%20to%20achieve%20those%20values.)
[Smart contracts but also social contracts](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html)

Don't get me wrong, there is nothing sacred and Ethereum ecosystems is a mess. But it's a working mess, a permissionless, forkable technology that likeminds could build upon.

Frankly speaking, the logistics is far from perfect and algining expectations of a diverse audience fairly and transparently is fundamentally challenging, but that's the point as we come here to join an [experiment](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/10/06/why-i-built-zuzalu/).

Identifying myself as a builder, thie trip won't be complete without getting my hands dirty on new ideas. With the motiv of creating "Community Notes" to make the experience more inclusive. Ended up with a scrappy demo but I'm pretty proud to have written code for the UI & smart contract on my flight back to Singapore without Internet, making to the submission deadline when I land in Singapore Airport. Can't be more happy getting the "Silver Squirrel" prizes covering my trip.   

Probably I've watched too much eposides of "The Dark", I wonder which year it I'm in walking along the stations. From color palette of the Deutsche Bahn schedules to the smell of train after a football match. As an outsider, Germany didnt seems to have changed much. Did I? 

Allow me to indulge in nostalgia, picking up memories from bookstores to supermarket, from Reichtag to the Brandenburg Gate. I got a chance to have dialogue with my younger self, pondered what I wished and feared. Still the curious and somehow idealistic person, perhaps. "Vorbei ist Vorbei", I can't change the past, but I'm gateful this trip helped me to reflect and reimagine what are paths I could be taking as I open a new chapter of my career and life.

I'm geuinely happy to be still alive, when my good old classmate is no longer so.
