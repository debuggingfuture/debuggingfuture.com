Our team hacked at ETHDenver and won Top 3 projects in DAO track!



💡WebApps are often the weakest link in security, misinformation and decentralization. With AI agents proliferating, what if we let AI take over and make websites autonomous?



📰 We built just that —a Bloomberg style website curated, written, reviewed, fact-checked and even deployed by Agents, with everything on-chain from the website articles, images to agent-agent messages.



🤖 That's a censorship-resistant website that no single human can tamper with --- meanwhile our systems allow DAOs to govern it with voting attestations, AgentArena (~Lmarena.AI) and Agent twins of community leaders. Just right after our hack Vitalik published his blog on "AI as the engine, humans as the steering wheel. -- a super exciting design space.



🏗️We employed Chain of Agents framework from Google Research to handle long context and improve interpretability, made use of EIP-4844 Blob for storage, polymarket UMA oracle data and Ethereum attestation service for fact check and verifiable inclusion.  



Always a blast hacking with Richard S! DM me if you have AI ideas to build and follow me on https://x.com/debuggingfuture for what's next!
