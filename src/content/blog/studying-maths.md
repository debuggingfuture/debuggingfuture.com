# Studying Mathematics in my mid-career

# Motivation Part

During covid, I embarked my journey studying Mathematics.


This post is about why, what I learnt, and the how --  some comments on latest AI toolings.  

It's also a time when various AI models and tools greatly evolved and this is also a journey shaping my process wih them. 

For my background, I studied Master of Computer science and have been working in Software Engineering for 13+ years, assumed role of startup founder and Tech Lead.

All in all, it's much more challenge than I expected
I have done different sorts of coursework, from error coding theories on quantum computing to practical oriented CKAD (K8s developer). 

While I'm studying I went through period of intensive job and also period of career break where there are weeks I focus exclusively in studying.

## Why

With lock down and work from home schedule, I had more time to read and setup my learning process. 
How I get started
		â—‹ From category theory
	- Programming Rust Mandelbrot fractal
	- soverngity

It was a time I got really burn out from working at startups, espeically the one I founded.

- not to satsify particular business or political agenda

It's not some legacy code or  buzz words, business or political disguised as technical problems 
This is not complex systems of legacy code of particular company. This is language of nature that I can discuss. 
When my grandsons are on Mars, I can still calculate date of reunion with Largarange constant and discuss his matehmatics homework. 




Fun part of software engineering is you can develop your taste and change things. However few years later debates on things like React Server components are no longer relevant. However with Mathematics, even when your grandson emmigrated to the Mars, you could still apply the same Lagrange formula to schedule a homecoming day. 


## Lesson - 1 Fundamentals

Somehow we believe in Theoretical Physics or Mathematics it takes a few Eureka moments to master some some big theorems, as if they are some fancy utlimate skills in a Diablo skill tree.

Turns out from my experience it is much more like Kung Fu, where it's always about the fundamentals. It takes concicious effort just to read the definitions and create mental model on what is happening. 

It's like tech debt that whenver I try to catch up and speedrun chapters, I find it very counterproductive. 

Only after persistent study of different topics, working on exercises and articulating to others, connections are made and you can have multiple perspsectives on things as simple as Pythagorean's theorem.

## Lesson 2


<!-- - Assume follows linearly and not skipping single word -->


This isn't a side project you can crunch as in a hackathon, persistence. 


	


Give me fresh eyes. 

Biggest motivation cut through the fluff and see things in first principle


Systematic point of view. Keep track of the big picture with meticulous details

Opportunity cost. Builder by heart, with all my curiosity to understand the world, I'm much more urge to apply knowledge and technologies I picked up.

Domain specific language

Identify definitions, context

Minimum

Keen


Used to picky

Care too much on credentials or programme

## Defining the Course

<!-- why the degree -->

I think I am not alone that I often met fellows who'd like to reeducate themselves on deeper topics when it is more affordable later in their life.   

Give how our higher education systems are funded, they emphasizing "Career prospectives" (in short-term), you often have either skill-based bootcamps (moneygrab) on hot topics or degrees designed for young students developing their career in academia, options for mature students are limited, espeically in Asia.

Forunately, at least resources for self-learning are abundant today thanks to MOOC like MIT Courseware, Khan Academy or Coursera. For Physics, Leonard Susskind famously taught [The Theoretical Minimum course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJfw6lDlTuA) as part of the Stanford Continuing Studies which is quite popular. 

Doing a few courses is different from developing the rigorous foundation and identifying unknown unknown of the field.

It is considerable effort drawing the map and I wanted get one from others so I can focus on hiking. For that reason I enrolled into the Open University. middle ground of a causal and formal Education.


There are some assignments and tutorials to keep me up, but I study mostly on my own.




### Energy management

- Much of the techniques Terrance Tao mentioned are suprisingly.

## What I learnt



### Spiritual

As an atheist with interest in a few ideas of Buddism, learning about science has always helped me to fill the void and make me appreciate the world.
Understanding the language of the nature, feeding my cursiosity motivates & empowers me to work as an Engineer.


Often I find my morning studing session feels more like a meditation exercise, echoing my experience in a Buddhist temple.
Eventually I did adapt binaural beats of buddist music to improve my focus.

Studying Maths is hard. It could be brutal and you get frustrated after days of studying you still struggle with basic definitions or propositions.  
With the all wisdom I do not understand, I learn to be humble. My ego is a joke when I read about Galois or Gauss, and I reflect my work ethics when
smart people like Terrence Tao has to [work very hard](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/work-hard/)


<!-- Accept frustration and fail as part of it -->


Focus is what it takes. Even with various techniques, my mind never stopped wander and we're used to unlimited triggers that steal our foucs.
I can always tell if I am in good condition and thereby I reflect on my choices, commitment and accept myself. 

On a good day I feel I learnt something and be more calm, with the hope that I train my self to think slower in the long run.


It's also part of my redemption -- I used to staring at algorithm assignments without clue, never confident I could ace leetcode or Brain teaser style interview questions.
Now there is time to and just bite the bullet when things are difficuly.

<!-- I was avoidant, although I never dispute the importance of data structure and enjoyed reading them. -->
  



Made slow but some progress in understanding the world. 
If monks wake up at 5 to mediate and chant


ACM contests 


Shawshank redemption
- Beauty . It's in here. No one can take that away

Some strikingly similar. Much of the time copying or reciting things i don't understand

In Modern world where our attentions are being auctioned,
we're overwhelemed on various beliefs or dogmas, by all sorts of agendas

No one is try to sell me anything. There is only Propositions and proof

filling void on beliefs.







Discipline. 

Emotions, missing hour of sleep become extremely evident 
While I try to work.



It's a luxury itself to put aside work and spend time to study, which I try to be grateful about.
At the same time, the inability to focus



### Be non superficial

inifite scrolling or multi tabs

wander

popularized account for "Deep work"




Mathematics is a different beast. 

Slowly


There are certain programming tasks that I can do while listening to podcast or even watching TVs.


Ask gemini to do deep research on a sample curriculum
Discuss optimal curriculum 

## Multi modal

It is not hard to be convinced importance high quality time is important
- How to make room for that in reality
I already did most of my learnings 

Speed run lectures on my thread mill

---


Be hyperaware of the context

Navigate map / context
Loss in details


Commit to sacrifice the high quality time of your weekends

Although I still ponder on questions





Trigger by buzzwords 
Active listen what people articulate

We get so used to superficial


### Community

- 

Is a lonely journey
Online communities, Hackernews


I used Gemini Deep research to ask silly questions such as how to read mathematical text slowly, with reddit hacker news.


Hacker news or reddit for inspirations or more times, empathy 

I admit in the lonely journey, I seek some social comfort and Concensus and click on real human


checking human




## End
- When you put spalsh of milk to glass of coffeePartial differential equations




## End


Focus is the valuable asset got stolen 

Read book
- lost

Readable ai
-- keep ask more


Are not lazy
Lazy in terms of comoute power
saving effort

## Delivery method

I have a love and hate relationship with Mathematical text. It provides structure 
and holding book avoided distractions. 

Most distriactions come from within and unengaged.
Authors assume you go linearly and you don't miss out any single word.  
Good training 
Read slow




History create conventions and notations
Specialized langauge. Language of the nature


Although Mathematical Text undoubtedly important
There are inherent limitations

Specialized skills
With gen ai -- explanatory
Gemini Live 
Live copilot as tutor, recall definitions

famously 


Gilbert Slang


Ability to skim over details and work on abstractions. 

Formulas are scary

Part of it is about Deliberate practices, I agree some r
Muscle memory is required to be developed. Reciting definitions and understanding proofs reinforce each other

Turning pages to look for definition 5.4 in another page which annotating another textbook which refer to theorem defined in last chapter. It is just not very modern. (Sometimes pages doesn't even match due to version difference)

Bigger part of content can be made bite sized



You don't understand a city like Hong Kong or Singapore without understanding demographics, connection flights and its strategic position as a british colony.

Understand statement by connections

Important parts



Latest tools, Without any explicit rag it is already possible to request llm to states answers using particular author


## Discipline
Like any sort of commitment as in marathon or work. You do it even when you don't feel like doing it

Lately Terrance Tao express the view that physics theory as compression. 

LLM is compression
