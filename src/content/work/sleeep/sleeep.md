# CTO, SLEEEP, Space is Ltd.
##### 2016 - Present (consultant-based)
[SLEEEP](https://sleeep.io) is a capsule hotel in Central, Hong Kong. It is a space for people to recharge in this city that never sleeps.
Being the Tech Guy, my work is to make technologies creating the experience, replacing friction with warmth. [Booking app - EXP](https://exp.sleeep.io) to reserve your next sleeping timeslot right away. QR Code as key to entry, with your SLPer(capsule) & locker then welcoming you with blinks. Slowly glowing light as alarm to adjust you from your sleep cycles.
